### Features

- Supports many DBMS üíæ
  - SQLite, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, Pandas (aka duckdb in a trenchcoat)
- Supports many models ‚ú®
      - Transformers, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- Easily extendable to [multi-modal usecases](./examples/vqa-ingredient.ipynb) üñºÔ∏è
- Write your normal queries - smart parsing optimizes what is passed to external functions üß†
      - Traverses abstract syntax tree with [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) to minimize LLM function calls üå≥
- Constrained decoding with [guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) üöÄ
      - When using local models, we only generate syntactically valid outputs according to query syntax + database contents
- LLM function caching, built on [diskcache](https://grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/) üîë

BlendSQL is a *superset of SQLite* for problem decomposition and hybrid question-answering with LLMs.

As a result, we can *Blend* together...

- ü•§ ...operations over heterogeneous data sources (e.g. tables, text, images)
- ü•§ ...the structured & interpretable reasoning of SQL with the generalizable reasoning of LLMs

It can be viewed as an inversion of the typical text-to-SQL paradigm, where a user calls a LLM, and the LLM calls a SQL program.

**Now, the user is given the control to oversee all calls (LLM + SQL) within a unified query language.**

For example, imagine we have the following table titled `parks`, containing [info on national parks in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States).

We can use BlendSQL to build a travel planning LLM chatbot to help us navigate the options below.

BlendSQL allows us to ask the following questions by injecting "ingredients", which are callable functions denoted by double curly brackets (`{{`, `}}`).

_Which parks don't have park facilities?_
```sql
SELECT "Name", "Description" FROM parks
  WHERE {{
      LLMMap(
          'Does this location have park facilities?',
          context='parks::Description'
      )
  }} = FALSE
```

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                            |
|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Everglades      | The country's northernmost park protects an expanse of pure wilderness in Alaska's Brooks Range and has no park facilities.            |

_What does the largest park in Alaska look like?_

```sql
SELECT "Name",
{{ImageCaption('parks::Image')}} as "Image Description",
{{
    LLMMap(
        question='Size in km2?',
        context='parks::Area'
    )
}} as "Size in km" FROM parks
WHERE "Location" = 'Alaska'
ORDER BY "Size in km" DESC LIMIT 1
```

| Name       | Image Description                                       |   Size in km |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|
| Everglades | A forest of tall trees with a sunset in the background. |      30448.1 |

<hr>

_Which state is the park in that protects an ash flow?_

```sql
SELECT "Location", "Name" AS "Park Protecting Ash Flow" FROM parks
    WHERE "Name" = {{
      LLMQA(
        'Which park protects an ash flow?',
        context=(SELECT "Name", "Description" FROM parks),
        options="parks::Name"
      )
  }}
```

| Location   | Park Protecting Ash Flow   |
|:-----------|:---------------------------|
| Alaska     | Katmai                     |

<hr>

_How many parks are located in more than 1 state?_

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parks
    WHERE {{LLMMap('How many states?', 'parks::Location')}} > 1
```

|   Count |
|--------:|
|       1 |

Now, we have an intermediate representation for our LLM to use that is explainable, debuggable, and [very effective at hybrid question-answering tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17882).
